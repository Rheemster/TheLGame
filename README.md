# The L Game

This is a small app based on this video by VSauce2.  I made this project to learn the basic interactions between CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

0.1 
* Initial commit
* The function to prevent overlap before passing turn is completely breaking the app.

0.2 
* Overlap function overhauled, still doesn't quite work currently. 
* L color switching fixed, coins now overlap L's on coin turns.

TODO:
* Prevent overlap
* Only allow one coin movement per turn
* Check win condition
* Add bot player
* Add analytics and information tabs
