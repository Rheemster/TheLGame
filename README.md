# The L Game

This is a small app based on this video by VSauce2.  I made this project to learn the basic interactions between CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Update March 25
Random bot players added.  They have an extremely bad algorithm that crashes the browser if it can't find an easy move.  Q now resets the board.

## Update Nov 23
Code completely refactored for easier implementation of analytics and bot.  L pieces can no longer stay in the same spot.  Help text now changes color depending on the current turn.

## Update Nov 22
Coins now don't overlap and will reset when switched.  L pieces can still stay in the same spot.

## Update Nov 20
Everything should work in the actual game except for win conditions and reset.  Analytics and information still to be implemented.
