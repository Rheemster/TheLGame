# The L Game

This is a small app based on this video by VSauce2.  I made this project to learn the basic interactions between CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Current status: 
0.1 ~~The function to prevent overlap before passing turn is completely breaking the app.~~
0.2 Overlap function overhauled, still doesn't quite work currently. 
    L color switching fixed, coins now overlap L's on coin turns.
